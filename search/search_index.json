At the moment, a user can generate partial charges from a GNN and pass them to <code>create_interchange</code> or <code>create_openmm_system</code> alongside a SMIRNOFF force field as prespecified charges. To use GNNs in a flagship force field, this approach is not sufficient, and the SMIRNOFF specification must be updated to include enough information that an external developer could get the same charges themselves. </p> <p>Who this EP would affect: The changes described in this proposal affect any consumer of SMIRNOFF force fields that include <code>&lt;NAGLCharges&gt;</code>, which is likely to be the case for <code>openff-2.3.0</code> and beyond.

If this proposal is accepted, OpenFF NAGL may need minor updates to properly check its GNN implementation against the details encoded in a SMIRNOFF force field, but we expect these changes will be minor because the proposed changes derive directly from this software.
