## Abstract

This change adds `periodic_method="Ewald3D"` as a supported attribute value in the `<vdW>` tag.

## Motivation and Scope

There are compelling reasons for force fields to handle long-range vdW interactions with an Ewald sum (so-called LJPME, used here synonymously) analogously to how electrostatics are conventionally handled, despite the increased computational cost. While tail corrections largely mediate the errors introduced by cutting off vdW interactions before they naturally decay to zero, they do so imperfectly, particularly in nonisotropic systems. These differences, even if small, also imply that a force field fitted with cut-off vdW interactions would not likely perform as well if LJPME is used.

LJPME is only valid for periodic systems, so the `nonperiodic_method` attribute is unaffected.

LJPME does not involve a tail correction or long-range dispersion correction, as these are only relevant with cut-off vdW interactions. These attributes are unaffected.

There are many details and user-provided options in various PME implementations that might affect results; this proposal does not attempt to resolve them and instead suggests that a future OFF-EP should handle these questions.

## Usage and Impact

LJPME is widely implemented in modern molecular simulation engines including [OpenMM](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.NonbondedForce.html?highlight=ljpme), [GROMACS](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/functions/long-range-vdw.html#lennard-jones-pme), Amber (link needed), CHARMM (link needed), and [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/pair_lj_long.html). Each implementation may differ slightly in its details; this proposal treats LJPME identically to PME for Coulombic interactions and leaves these questions unresolved.

While engine support for LJPME is strong, there may be compatibility issues in downstream methods such as free energy calculations or the use of non-Lennard-Jones potentials. We estimate these to be relatively rare and that a vast majority of use cases will be able to use LJPME without major hindrance.

Users may themselves wish to tinker with options specified in a SMIRNOFF force field, such as not using LJPME even if `periodic_method="Ewald3D"` is specified. There is nothing a force field specification can do to prevent modifications like this, identically to other potentially disruptive user modifications such as changing the cut-off distance.

This proposal only adds a non-default option and does not make recommendations of which option is best.

## Backward compatibility

This proposal only *adds a new supported value* for one attribute and makes no other changes, so it should be backwards-compatible with all current and compliant implementations. Conversion from version 0.4 should not change the information content of an OFFXML file or in-memory representation.

(I'm not sure if this change necessitates a bump in the version; nothing is added or removed and the defaults are unchanged, but if there is no bump I can't envision a clear answer to the question of "is LJPME supported in version 0.4?" so I lean toward thinking it is needed.)

## Detailed description

This change adds `"Ewald3D"` as a supported value of the `periodic_method` attribute in the `<vdW>` tag:

```
* `Ewald3D`: a method like [particle mesh Ewald](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory.html#coulomb-interaction-with-particle-mesh-ewald) should be used
```

The description is nearly identical to how the `periodic_potential` attribute of the `<Electrostatics>` section is described.

This change corresponds to a bump in the vdW version from 0.4 to 0.5. All other aspects of the vdW section remain unchanged, including the default `"periodic_method="cutoff"`.

## Alternatives

[OFF-EP-0007b](https://github.com/openforcefield/standards/pull/44) includes this change as part of a larger overhaul with long-range dispersion corrections. That was introduced before [OFF-EP-0008](https://github.com/openforcefield/standards/pull/53) split the `method` attribute into `periodic_method` and `nonperiodic_method` methods and it placed the LJPME option within a new `long_range_treatment` attribute. This might lead to confusing and self-inconsistent combinations of attribute values such as

```XML
<vdW ... periodic_method="cutoff" nonperiodic_method="no-cutoff" long_range_treatment="Ewald3D-ConductingBoundary" </vdW>
```

This proposal suggests that `nonperiodic_method` is a more natural place to specify the use of LJPME.

This proposal does not attempt to generally resolve current ambiguities in long-range disperson treatment or how cut-off vdW interactions are handled.
