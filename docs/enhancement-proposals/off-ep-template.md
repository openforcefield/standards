examples that wouldn't  be possible without acceptance and implementation 
of this proposal, as well as the impact the proposed changes would have 
on the ecosystem.

This section describes the ways in which the proposal breaks backward
compatibility, and the migrations / strategies that will be implemented
to reduce the inconvenience caused to the users.
