## Abstract

This change would update the SMIRNOFF DivalentLonePair virtual site specification to allow virtual sites to be defined using both
an in-plane and an out-of-plane angle.

## Motivation and Scope

The current implementation of DivalentLonePair sites allows the geometry to be specified with the distance and outOfPlaneAngle 
parameters. There are a number of useful virtual site geometries which cannot be achieved with these parameters. Adding an
inPlaneAngle parameter would allow these, and other geometries to be generated using the DivalentLonePair site.

## Usage and Impact

This section describes how users of the ecosystem will use features 
described in this SMIRNOFF EP. It should be comprised mainly of code / file 
examples that wouldn't  be possible without acceptance and implementation 
of this proposal, as well as the impact the proposed changes would have 
on the ecosystem. 

## Backward compatibility

This would require all DivalentLonePair sites to specify an inPlaneAngle parameter.
Any existing implementations would need to set this to 0 to capture the same geometries
as before. 

## Detailed description

This section should provide a detailed description of the proposed
change. It should include examples of how the new functionality would be
used, intended use-cases and pseudo-code illustrating its use.
