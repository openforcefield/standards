## Abstract

A short description of the change being addressed.

## Motivation and Scope

This section describes the need for the proposed change. It should
describe the existing problem, who it affects, what it is trying to
solve, and why. This section should explicitly address the scope of and
key requirements for the proposed change.
If the proposal is based around changes to software, this section should clearly indicate which package(s) would be changed.

## Usage and Impact

This section describes how users of the ecosystem will use features 
described in this SMIRNOFF EP. It should be comprised mainly of code / file 
examples that wouldn't  be possible without acceptance and implementation 
of this proposal, as well as the impact the proposed changes would have 
on the ecosystem. 

## Backward compatibility

This adds a new section which cannot meaningfully be converted to any existing sections.

## Detailed description

This section should provide a detailed description of the proposed
change. It should include examples of how the new functionality would be
used, intended use-cases and pseudo-code illustrating its use.

## Alternatives

The first GNN trained with the intent to be shipped in SMIRNOFF force fields is one that models AM1-BCC partial
charges, so another solution could involve updating the existing `<ToolkitAM1BCC>` section instead of adding a new
section altogether. This might involve a new tag in the `<ToolkitAM1BCC>` section that distinguishes a particular GNN
from the existing QuacPac and/or `sqm`-based approach. This approach is limiting, however, since GNNs can be used to
predict other charge models than AM1-BCC; if a GNN was trained to ABCG2 or a RESP variant, it's not obvious if that
could drop in to `<ToolkitAM1BCC>`.

Another similar solution could involve not updating the SMIRNOFF specification at all and simply letting
implementations use GNNs in place of QuacPac or `sqm` as currently specified. This in principle produces the same
results, to the extent that the GNN accurately reproduces AM1-BCC charges, but is inconsistent with the philosophy that
the details of a force field must be communicated to users and not hidden from view.

The solution in this proposal makes clear to any person or tool inspecting a force field that GNNs are a different tool
than existing AM1-BCC charge providers. It attempts to provide enough detail that somebody could re-implement the same
GNN provided weights that are shipped alongside a force field. It allows for future modifications in which a different
underlying charge model is targeted.
