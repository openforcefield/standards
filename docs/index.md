# OpenFF Standards

This page provides an overview of the different standards employed accross the OpenFF ecosystem. Specifically, it 
contains standards documents which encompass both the specification of core data models and formats and standard 
operating procedures, as well as OpenFF Enhancement Proposals (OFF-EPs)—suggested changes to the standards—in various 
stages of discussion or completion.

## Standards

##### Data Models

* [SMIRNOFF Specification](standards/smirnoff.md) - the SMIRNOFF specification defines the format that molecular 
  mechanics force fields from the Open Force Field Initiative are store and distributed in.

##### Procedures
  
* [QM Data Set Submission](standards/qm-data-submission.md) - the standards and data requirements needed for submitting 
  an OpenFF curated dataset to QCArchive.

## Enhancement Proposals

##### Meta-Proposals

* [OFF-EP 0 &mdash; Purpose and Process](enhancement-proposals/off-ep-0000.md)
* [OFF-EP X &mdash; Template](enhancement-proposals/off-ep-template.md)

##### Accepted Proposals

* [OFF-EP 1 &mdash; Clarify that constraint distances override equilibrium bond distances](enhancement-proposals/off-ep-0001.md)

##### Open Proposals

##### Final Proposals
